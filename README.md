# US-HEALTHCARE-DATA-ANALYSIS PROJECT

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of patient data from 10 major hospitals across the U.S., focusing on uncovering actionable insights to drive better healthcare decisions, optimize treatment costs, and improve patient outcomes.

## Overview
The dataset consists of **55,500 unique patient records**, capturing information on hospital admissions, medical conditions, medications, insurance providers, and treatment costs.

The analysis addresses key stakeholder questions, with clear, actionable insights presented in both technical and simplified formats.

## Key Stakeholder Questions
- What are the most common age groups, genders, and blood types among patients? Are certain groups being admitted more often than others?
- Which medical conditions are diagnosed the most, and do they affect certain groups of people more than others?
- How long do patients typically stay in the hospital for different conditions? Does this vary depending on the hospital or type of admission (emergency, urgent, or planned)?
- How much does treatment usually cost for each condition? Are there big differences in costs between hospitals or insurance providers?
- Which hospitals are treating the most patients, and how do they compare in terms of patient outcomes, like test results?
- What medications are most often prescribed for each condition? Are they being used consistently across hospitals?
- How are patients admitted – mostly through emergency, urgent, or planned admissions – and how does that impact the length of stay or treatment costs?
- Which insurance companies are covering the most patients, and how does that relate to treatment costs and patient outcomes?
- Where are the hospitals located, and are there any regional differences in health conditions, treatment quality, or billing amounts?

## Key Insights
- Older adults (60+) make up the majority of admissions.
- Diabetes and hypertension are the most diagnosed conditions.
- Average hospital stay is 15–16 days across conditions.
- Costs are consistent, ranging from $25,000 to $26,000.
- Houston Methodist Hospital treats the most patients but shows a higher rate of abnormal outcomes.
- Medications like Aspirin, Ibuprofen, and Lipitor are used consistently.
- Insurance coverage is fairly balanced, but outcomes vary more by hospital.

## Recommendations
1. Strengthen chronic disease prevention and management.
2. Reduce emergency admissions through better access to care.
3. Improve discharge planning to shorten hospital stays.
4. Standardize medication use across hospitals.
5. Collaborate with insurers to optimize cost and care quality.
6. Share best practices among hospitals.
7. Tailor strategies to regional health needs.

## Technologies Used
- **Ms Excel**: Data analysis and report generation
- **Ms Excel Pivot Analysis**: Data processing and exploration
- **Microsoft Word**: Final report generation
